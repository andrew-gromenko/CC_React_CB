# Eggcllnt boilerplate
Crated to make life easier

### Intro
I created this boilerplate for my team to start our projects quick and not painful.
This Boilerplate includes technologies like:

* ECMAScript 2016 - 2017
* React
* Redux
* Thunk/Saga
* Jest
* Enzyme
* Webpack + HMR + Tree shaking
* Sass + Postcss

And more.

### Quick start
Runs [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) on [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000)  
If you want to change the port or the host you can simply run command with `PORT=<PORT>` or `HOST=<HOST>`, or both at the same time.

```
npm start
```

To run production build run
```
npm run build
```

To run tests
```
npm test
```

To check tests coverage go to `coverage/lcov-report` folder and open `index.html` in browser.
